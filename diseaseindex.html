    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="C:\Users\SLIM5\OneDrive\Documents\Project_sem6\New folder\breastcan.png" /><br/><br/>
   </div>
   <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>A cancer that develops in the breast cells and progresses in stages. Few early symptoms may include new lump in the underarm or in breast, itching or discharge from the nipples, and skin texture change of the nipple or breast.<br></p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A lump or mass in the breast that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
      <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast.</li>
      <li>Discharge from the nipple</li>
      <li>Breast rash</li>
      <li>Changes in the skin over the breast, for example, dimpling</li>
      <li>Breast pain</li>
      <li>Inverted or pulling-in of the nipple</li>
      <li>Scaling, peeling, or flaking skin over the breast, particularly the dark area around the nipple</li>
      <li>Redness and/or pitting of the breast skin, resembling the skin of orange</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.<br>
Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.
<br>
Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>
<br>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Treatment is primarily based on the type and stage of cancer.</li>
    <li>Uses high-powered energy rays to destroy cancer cells.- Can be done using a machine or by implanting a radioactive material inside the tumor mass</li>
    <li>Lumpectomy. The entire tumor mass and some of the surrounding healthy tissues are removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style = "color:  rgb(21, 112, 21)">Prevention</h3>
<p>Limit or stay away from alcohol.<br>
    Stay at a healthy weight<br>
    Get active.<br>
    Breastfeed<br>
    Limit hormone therapy after menopause.</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="C:\Users\SLIM5\OneDrive\Documents\Project_sem6\New folder\diabetes.png" /><br/><br/>
   </div>
   <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.</p>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Genetic Predisposition:</b> Individuals with a family history of diabetes are at higher risk due to inherited genetic susceptibility.</li>
    <li><b>Lifestyle Choices:</b> Sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and obesity significantly increase the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. Consuming excessive refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and processed foods can contribute to insulin resistance and weight gain.</li>
    <li><b>Physical Inactivity:</b> Lack of regular physical activity impairs glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, predisposing individuals to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li><b>Gestational Factors:</b> Gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy, can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life for both the mother and the child.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Feeling more thirsty than usual.</li>
  <li>Urinating often.</li>
  <li>Losing weight without trying</li>
  <li>Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin.</li>
  <li>Feeling tired and weak.</li>
  <li>Feeling irritable or having other mood changes.</li>
  <li>Having blurry vision.</li>
  <li>Having slow-healing sores.</li>
  <li>Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections. Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections. Insulin is the main treatment for type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. It replaces the hormone your body isn’t able to produce.</p>
<br>
<h3 style = "color:  rgb(21, 112, 21)">Prevention</h3>
<p>Lose extra weight<br>
    Be more physically active<br>
    Eat healthy plant foods<br>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="C:\Users\SLIM5\OneDrive\Documents\Project_sem6\New folder\heartdis.jpg" /><br/>
   </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.<br>
  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.<br>
Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath</li>
  <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</li>
  <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Elevated blood pressure puts strain on the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.</li>
    <li>Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (often referred to as "bad" cholesterol) can lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow to the heart, which may result in heart disease and heart attacks.</li>
    <li>Tobacco use, including smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, significantly increases the risk of heart disease by damaging blood vessels, reducing oxygen in the blood, and raising blood pressure.</li>
    <li>Diets high in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and sugar increase the risk of heart disease. Conversely, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help reduce the risk.</li>
    <li>People with diabetes are at higher risk of developing heart disease due to factors such as high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and other metabolic abnormalities that affect the cardiovascular system.</li>
    <li>Chronic stress and untreated mental health conditions like depression and anxiety can contribute to heart disease by increasing blood pressure, promoting unhealthy coping behaviors (such as smoking or overeating), and triggering inflammation in the body.</li>
    <li>The risk of heart disease increases with age. As people get older, their risk of developing heart disease, especially coronary artery disease, rises due to factors such as decreased elasticity of blood vessels and accumulation of plaque.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle is crucial for managing heart disease. This includes maintaining a healthy diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium; engaging in regular physical activity; quitting smoking; and managing stress.<br>
    Angioplasty and stenting to open blocked or narrowed coronary arteries.<br>
    Cardiac rehabilitation programs offer comprehensive, supervised exercise training, education, and support to improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of future heart events. These programs are typically recommended after a heart attack, heart surgery, or for individuals with stable heart disease.<br>
    Regular monitoring of heart health through tests such as electrocardiograms (ECGs or EKGs), echocardiograms, stress tests, and blood tests is essential for managing heart disease and adjusting treatment as needed.
</p>
<br>
<h3 style = "color:  rgb(21, 112, 21)">Prevention</h3>
<p>Don't smoke or use tobacco<br>
    Get moving: Aim for at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity daily<br>
    Eat a heart-healthy diet<br>
    Maintain a healthy weight<br>
    Get quality sleep<br>
    Manage stress<br>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="C:\Users\SLIM5\OneDrive\Documents\Project_sem6\New folder\parkinson.jpg" /><br/>
   </div>
   <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Parkinson disease (PD) is a brain condition that causes problems with movement, mental health, sleep, pain and other health issues.
    PD gets worse over time. There is no cure, but therapies and medicines can reduce symptoms. Common symptoms include tremors, painful muscle contractions and difficulty speaking.
    Parkinson disease results in high rates of disability and the need for care. Many people with PD also develop dementia.
    The disease usually occurs in older people, but younger people can also be affected. Men are affected more often than women.
    The cause of PD is unknown but people with a family history of the disease have a higher risk. Exposure to air pollution, pesticides and solvents may increase risk.
</p>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells called neurons in the brain gradually break down or die. Many of the symptoms of Parkinson's are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes irregular brain activity, leading to problems with movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</li>
   <li>Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic markers of Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease.</li>
    <li>Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is small.</li>
    <li>Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than are women.</li>
    <li>Many of the symptoms of Parkinson's are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes irregular brain activity, leading to problems with movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>tremor</li>
    <li>involuntary movement</li>
    <li>rigidity</li>
    <li>trouble walking</li>
    <li>imbalance</li>
    <li>cognitive impairment</li>
    <li>mental health disorders</li>
    <li>dementia</li>
    <li>sleep disorders</li>
    <li>pain</li>
    <li>sensory disturbances</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>There is no cure for Parkinson disease, but therapies including medicines, surgery and rehabilitation can reduce symptoms.
    Levodopa/carbidopa, a combination medicine that increases the amount of dopamine in the brain, is the most common medication for PD (1). Doctors may use other medicines such as anticholinergics to reduce involuntary muscle movement.  
    Deep brain stimulation and other therapies can help the tremors and reduce the need for medicines.
    Rehabilitation including physiotherapy can offer relief for Parkinson disease</p>
<br>
<h3 style = "color:  rgb(21, 112, 21)">Prevention</h3>
<p>Because the cause of Parkinson's is unknown, there are no proven ways to prevent the disease.

    Some research has shown that regular aerobic exercise might reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease.
    
    Some other research has shown that people who consume caffeine — which is found in coffee, tea and cola — get Parkinson's disease less often than those who don't drink it. Green tea also is related to a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease. However, it is still not known whether caffeine protects against getting Parkinson's or is related in some other way. Currently there is not enough evidence to suggest that drinking caffeinated beverages protects against Parkinson's.</p>

<h2 style = "color : rgb(4, 95, 95)">5. Pneumonia Disease</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="C:\Users\SLIM5\OneDrive\Documents\Project_sem6\New folder\pneumonia.jpg" /><br/>
   </div>
   <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.<br>
    Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Chest pain when you breathe or cough</li>
  <li>Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)</li>
  <li>Fatigue</li>
  <li>Fever, sweating and shaking chills</li>
  <li>Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
  <br>

  <h3>Causes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia.</li>
    <li>Viruses, including COVID-19. Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe.</li>
    <li>This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms.</li>
    <li>Smoking damages your body's natural defenses against the bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>Treatment for pneumonia involves curing the infection and preventing complications. People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more.<br>
    You may take these as needed for fever and discomfort. These include drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).<br>
    These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic</p>

    <h3 style = "color:  rgb(21, 112, 21)">Prevention</h3>
    <p>Get vaccinated.<br>
    Practice good hygiene<br>
    Don't smoke. <br>
    Keep your immune system strong.</p>
